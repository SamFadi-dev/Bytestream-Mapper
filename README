# MAGIC Project

This project implements a MAGIC data structure based on a red-black tree. It provides functionality to add, remove, and map positions in a stream.

## Project Structure

- `src/magic.c` and `src/magic.h`: Implementation of the MAGIC data structure.
- `main_test.c`: Contains unit tests for the MAGIC data structure.
- `main_perf.c`: Contains performance tests for the MAGIC data structure.
- `Makefile`: Build and run automation for the project.

## Prerequisites

- GCC compiler (or any C compiler).
- Make utility.
- A terminal or command prompt.

## Build Instructions

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run the following command to build the project:
   ```sh
   make
   ```

## Running the Code

### Run Unit Tests
To execute the unit tests:
```sh
make test
./test
```

### Run Performance Tests
To execute the performance tests:
```sh
make perf
./perf
```

### Run Both Tests
To run both unit and performance tests:
```sh
make run
```

## Cleaning Up
To clean up the build files and executables:
```sh
make cleanWin
```
or
```sh
make cleanLinux
```

## Notes
- Ensure that the `gcc` compiler is installed and available in your system's PATH.
